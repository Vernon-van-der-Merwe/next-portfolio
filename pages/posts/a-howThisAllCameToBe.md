# How this all came to be
## Step 1: My plan
How am I going to document my process? What will I use for documentation?
    - I want something fun
    - Easy to set up and use
    - Something to provide my online presence some value.

I have already used a documentation framework called nextra,but that didn’t provide any future value for me personally. It was just two sites I spent 8-16 hours on, but I had nothing to how for it in the end, unless I send around the link.

My thinking is that I have to extend my online presence somehow, to show my progress, inspire some people and have some fun, so lets see if nextra can do that aswell.

I want to document my challenges, since besides for a company test every now and then, or some passion projects here and there us engineers are challenged by so many personal challenges as-well, that can provide a potential employer, client or even junior or potential Engineer with valuable insight on how to thing and approach a problem.
### Practicle example of what this would be good for
At the fintech company I worked for, we were fully remote. Which meant that we were also in some sense disconnected, besides for our work and deliverables
- My partial solution to this part was to build something, that can make slack status updates more natural and easy.
- I wanted to be able to update my status anywhere any time, at the press of a button to show my colleages that I am:
    - Making coffe (15 min)
    - Out and about (1hr)
    - Getting food (1hr)
    - etc.

After spending a few days with this solution, I don't really have anything to show for it today… Lets build something that can change that.

### Project Requirements: 
- Provide a platform where I can: 
- Document my engineering problems and solutions
- Explain and visualise my thinking
- Document the structure of the application and all the relevant links info and resources used(Basically easy documentation and visualisation)
- Display my solution.
